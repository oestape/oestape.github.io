# Spring motion - Hooke's law

[Hooke's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law) says F = -kx where F is the force of the spring, k is a constant characteristic of the spring and x is the displacement. This means that the force done by the spring is directly proportional on how stretched it is.
