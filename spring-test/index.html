# Spring motion - Hooke's law

[Hooke's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law) says F = -kx where F is the force of the spring, k is a constant characteristic of the spring and x is the displacement. This means that the force done by the spring is directly proportional on how stretched it is.

[Friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction) is a force that depends on the weight (mass) and the types of materials and it is constant once the object is moving (it doesn't increase with speed). If the force that tries to move the object is lower than that friction force, then friction just matches the moving force so it stays still.
